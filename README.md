# Colorization
Recoloring black and white photos using a neural network made from scratch. Project for CS520 (Graduate level Introduction to Artificial Intelligence) @ Rutgers.

Basic Agent: Recolors black and white photo based on the 5 most present colors in surrounding pixels in test data using k-means algorithm written from scratch.
Improved Agent 1: Recolors black and white photo using a neural network trained on discrete colors in test data. 
Improved Agent 2: Recolors black and white photo using a neural network trained on the 5 most present colors in test data using k-means algorithm written from scratch.
